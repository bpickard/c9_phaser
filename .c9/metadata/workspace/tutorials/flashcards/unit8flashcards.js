Durkheim described “anomie” as a state of lawlessness, normlessness, or unrestrained ambition, which if left unchecked could lead to a breakdown in social solidarity. Durkheim said that a state of anomie would arise when the “forces of integration” (social bonds and collective beliefs) and the “forces of regulation” (laws and social institutions) were out of balance, and not functioning properly. Merton used Durkheim’s concept of anomie to explain high crime rates in American society. Merton argued that a dysfunction (an imbalance) existed between the cultural goals of American society (e.g., accumulation of wealth and social advancement) and access to the institutional means through which to achieve those cultural goals (e.g., getting a good education, or finding good employment opportunities).

These three social domains structure our lives—where we spend our time, where we are most likely to intersect with other people, where we are most likely to find opportunities to commit crime, and where we are most likely to become a victim of crime.

Agnew described the sources of strain experienced by teens as “the presentation of negative stimuli” (e.g., parental punishment) and “the removal of positively valued stimuli” (e.g., being kicked off the high school basketball team), arguing that these strains or stressors could lead to frustration, anger, and, in some cases, to juvenile delinquency."}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"action":"removeText","range":{"start":{"row":10,"column":24},"end":{"row":10,"column":51}},"text":"The Environmental Backcloth"},{"action":"insertText","range":{"start":{"row":10,"column":24},"end":{"row":10,"column":41}},"text":"Strain Moderators"}]}],[{"group":"doc","deltas":[{"action":"removeText","range":{"start":{"row":10,"column":55},"end":{"row":10,"column":792}},"text":"A term used by environmental criminologists Patricia and Paul Brantingham, to describe the elements that surround the criminal event.

If criminals go through a reasoning process, however limited that process might be, and if they do indeed weigh the costs and benefits of committing a crime, then if you can make the costs outweigh the benefits, they will presumably be deterred (or at least, less motivated).

It examines how social bonds—and the propensity for delinquency and criminality—change as individuals transition through the life stages of childhood, adolescence, young adulthood and adulthood.
